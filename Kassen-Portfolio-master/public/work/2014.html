<p>2015 TEASER...<br />
    <br />
    A small recap from 2014. Some of this footage is upcoming project&#039;s in 2015. STAY TUNED.<br />
    I have finally figured out what I want to do for the rest of my life. Shoot and explore the world, and thereafter show cinematic&#039;s threw the screen for the rest of the world. My goal is to inspire and disseminate other people out there. I really love filming, and I hope the future is there, ready for me. This footage is filmed with GH3. I have been lucky enough to be given the opportunity to borrow the camera from my friend Espen. <br />

    Thanks to all my friends &amp; fam for the support.</p>
